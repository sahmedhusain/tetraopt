## Overview

**Tetris Optimizer** is a command-line program written in **Go** that reads tetromino pieces from a text file and arranges them into the smallest possible square using a backtracking algorithm.

Designed as an algorithmic optimization project, Tetris Optimizer demonstrates core concepts such as file parsing, shape rotation, recursive backtracking, and spatial optimization.

---

## ✨ Features

Tetris Optimizer includes the following core features:

- **File Parsing** 📄  
  Reads and validates tetromino pieces from text files. It checks for correct format, 4-line blocks, and valid character usage.

- **Shape Validation** ✅  
  Ensures all pieces are valid tetrominoes:
  - Exactly 4 blocks (`#`).
  - All blocks are connected (validated via DFS/BFS).
  - Proper 4x4 grid spacing.

- **Rotation Logic** 🔄  
  Automatically generates all unique rotations of each piece to maximize fitting potential. It handles symmetry detection to avoid redundant checks.

- **Backtracking Algorithm** 🎯  
  Intelligently places pieces using recursive backtracking. If a piece doesn't fit, it backtracks to the previous piece and tries a new position or rotation.

- **Size Optimization** 📐  
  Finds the **smallest possible square** that fits all pieces. It starts from the theoretical minimum size (`ceil(sqrt(n*4))`) and expands incrementally until a solution is found.

- **Error Handling** ⚠️  
  Prints "ERROR" for invalid input files or malformed tetrominoes, ensuring robust execution.

## 🧠 Logic & Flow

The application follows a structured pipeline from parsing to solving. Below are visual representations of the system's logic.

### 1. High-Level Execution Flow

This flowchart illustrates the lifecycle of the program from command-line argument to final output.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A([Start]) --> B{Check Args}
    B -- Invalid --> C[Print Usage Error] --> Z([End])
    B -- Valid --> D[Parse File]

    D --> E{Valid Format?}
    E -- No --> F[Print "ERROR"] --> Z
    E -- Yes --> G[Generate Rotations for All Pieces]

    G --> H[Calculate Min Board Size]
    H --> I[Attempt to Solve (Backtracking)]

    I --> J{Solution Found?}
    J -- Yes --> K[Print Board] --> Z
    J -- No --> L[Increase Board Size] --> I
```

### 2. Backtracking Algorithm (The Core)

The core logical engine uses recursive backtracking to fit pieces. This state diagram shows how the solver decides where to place pieces.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> SelectPiece

    state "Recursion Loop" as Loop {
        SelectPiece --> TryPosition
        TryPosition --> CheckFit: Can Place?

        CheckFit --> PlacePiece: Yes
        PlacePiece --> NextPiece: Recurse (Next ID)

        CheckFit --> TryNextRotation: No
        TryNextRotation --> TryPosition: Has Rotations
        TryNextRotation --> Backtrack: No Rotations Left

        NextPiece --> Solved: All Placed
        NextPiece --> Backtrack: Failed Deep

        Backtrack --> RemovePiece: Undo Move
        RemovePiece --> TryPosition: Try Next Pos
    }

    Solved --> [*]: Return Board
```

### 3. Application Structure

The code is organized into modular packages to separate concerns.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    direction TB
    class Main {
        +main()
        +Orchestrate Flow
    }

    class Parser {
        +ParseFile(path)
        +ValidateShape()
        +Normalize()
        +CheckConnectivity()
    }

    class Solver {
        +Solve(pieces)
        +solveRecursive(board, index)
    }

    class Board {
        +Size
        +Grid
        +NewBoard(size)
        +Place(piece)
        +Remove(piece)
        +String()
    }

    class Tetromino {
        +ID
        +Letter
        +Blocks []Point
        +Rotations
    }

    Main --> Parser : Reads Input
    Main --> Solver : Requests Solution
    Solver --> Board : Manipulates
    Solver --> Tetromino : Arranges
    Parser --> Tetromino : Creates
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Go 1.20+** 🐹 – Core language and standard libraries
- **File I/O** 📁 – Reading and parsing tetromino files
- **Algorithms** 🧮 – Backtracking and recursive optimization
- **Data Structures** 📊 – 2D grids and coordinate systems

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go version **1.20 or newer**
- A terminal to run the program

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://learn.reboot01.com/git/sayehusain/tetris-optimizer
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd tetris-optimizer
   ```

3. **Install dependencies (if any):**

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

   _(Note: This project strictly uses the standard library, so no external modules are fetched)_

4. **Build the program:**
   ```bash
   go build -o tetris-optimizer
   ```

---

## 📖 How to Use

Run the program by passing a text file containing tetromino definitions as an argument.

### Basic Usage

```bash
go run . testdata/sample.txt
```

Or using the compiled binary:

```bash
./tetris-optimizer testdata/sample.txt
```

### Input File Format

Each tetromino must be represented as a **4x4 grid** using `#` for blocks and `.` for empty spaces. Consecutive pieces must be separated by **one empty line**.

**Example Input (`sample.txt`):**

```text
...#
...#
...#
...#

....
....
....
####

.###
...#
....
....
```

### Output Example

The program prints the smallest square board with pieces identified by letters (A, B, C...) corresponding to their order in the input file.

```bash
$ ./tetris-optimizer testdata/sample.txt
ABBBB.
ACCCEE
AFFCEE
A.FFGG
HHHDDG
.HDD.G
```
